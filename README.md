DATS 6103 - Individual Project 2: Analyzing Child HIV Prevalence Across Nine Different Countries of High HIV Prevalence
The purpose of this project is to analyze the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in children in different countries around the globe. In addition, healthcare spending per capita in USD will be compared to the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in children.

Details of the project:

Datasets used: “Key HIV epidemiology indicators for children and adolescents aged 0-19, 2000-2019” via UNICEF & “Worldbank Healthcare Expenditure per Capita (Current US$) Dataset” via World Bank

Countries with the highest prevalence of children (children 0-14 years old) living with HIV were chosen from three main regions: Africa, Asia, and South America. These countries are Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Haiti, Pakistan, Philippines, and Venezuela.

Time period: 2010-2017

Specific datasets analyzed:

Estimated number of Annual AIDS- Related deaths globally (For all countries in the dataset)
Total Estimated Number of Children Living with HIV-AIDS
Annual New HIV Infections in Children
Annual New HIV Infections in Children as a rate per 1000 uninfected children
Healthcare spending per capita in USD
The different datasets were created using python in Juypter Notebook. 
*You can access the plots and figures via Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/4266957

Conclusions
In 2014, the National Health Bill was enacted in Nigeria to enact social health insurance, which transitioned health payments from private out-of-pocket to a national system where health care was free for select citizens. This actually lead to an increase in annual new HIV cases and HIV incidence rate.

Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Myanmar show decreases in new HIV cases with increase in Healthcare Spending per capita.

Pakistan shows an increase in healthcare spending per capita, but also an increase in new HIV cases in children. Pakistan has been criticized for insufficient healthcare protection for children.

Venezuela’s unique economic climate also presents a unique positive correlation between decrease in healthcare spending per capita and new HIV cases in children,.

While Philippines has increased healthcare spending per capita, an HIV-AIDS epidemic currently requires a need to address this issue through policy changes in healthcare spending.

Each HIV-AIDS situation is unique and it is important to provide the proper context from different regions (in terms of healthcare spending) in order to properly address the HIV-AIDS crisis that is of particular threat during this COVID-19 Pandemic.
